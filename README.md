The specifications for the tasks are in this repo: https://github.com/TonyJenkins/lbu-assignment-specs-ds

Some of the folders here contain sample input files that may be of use for clarifying the requirements.

_Please keep the folder (directory) structure from this template and use the provided separate folders for each task. It will 
make marking easier._

_There is a ``.gitignore`` file in this repo that should keep unwanted files from Git. You may add to it if you need to, but
please do not remove anything._

_If your work uses a Virtual Environment that will *not* be uploaded to Git. You should include a ``requirements.txt``
file to document the dependencies in the standard way. It is generated like so:_

_``$ pip freeze > requirements.txt``_
